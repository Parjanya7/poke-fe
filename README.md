# Pokemon Application

A simple Pokemon application built using React, TypeScript, and the PokeAPI.

## Summary

This application fetches a list of Pokemon from the PokeAPI and displays their details, including name, HP, attack, and defense stats. It allows users to sort the Pokemon list by HP and provides pagination to navigate through the list.

## Approach

The approach to building this application involved the following steps:

1. **Setup**: Set up the project structure using React and TypeScript. Initialized a Git repository to track changes.

2. **Fetch Pokemon Data**: Utilized the PokeAPI to fetch a list of Pokemon, including their stats and sprites. Implemented logic to retrieve the necessary information for each Pokemon.

3. **Display Pokemon List**: Created a component to display the list of Pokemon, including their name, HP, attack, and defense stats. Used CSS for styling and layout.

4. **Sorting**: Implemented sorting functionality to allow users to sort the Pokemon list by HP. Toggled sorting direction between ascending and descending.

5. **Pagination**: Added pagination functionality to handle large lists of Pokemon. Implemented pagination logic to display a subset of Pokemon per page.

6. **Styling**: Styled the application using CSS to improve the visual appearance. Applied a dark theme, attractive font family, and appealing design for the cards and pagination.

## Tech Choices

- **React**: Chosen for its component-based architecture and efficient rendering, making it suitable for building dynamic web applications.
- **TypeScript**: Used to add static typing to JavaScript, improving code readability and catching errors during development.
- **PokeAPI**: Used as the data source for retrieving Pokemon information, including stats and sprites.
- **react-paginate**: Utilized for implementing pagination functionality with a customizable and easy-to-use component.

## Instructions

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash

git clone <repository-url>

cd poke-fe

npm install

npm run start
